I am currently taking CPRE 491, which is the first part of senior design. We have not finished a prototype for this class yet as we're still in a period of research for our project. The majority of the work on this project will take place next semester in CPRE 492. 

Our project is on having sucessful key exchanges without the use of TCP/IP. This would mean absolutely no one would be able to view the transaction of the plaintext data sent in the initilaization of the key exchange. This is something that many in security fields would fine useful. It strengthens the data transfer between two partners and lessens the likelyhood that any of the original plaintext is leaked to anyone preforming man in the middle attempts. 

I will be taking one of the roles as Interface Engineer. My job will be in charge of developing a tool for interfacing with a deviceâ€™s different interfaces which we will used for data transfer in close proximity. I have an interest in developing an application for other projects as well as this one in similar ways, so I think this will be beneficial to me. I am also interested in RF and audio, which will be some of the interfaces we will be using.
