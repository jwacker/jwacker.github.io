My Name is Joel Wacker. I am currently a Senior in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. I am looking to work Full Time starting May 2020 in a Blue Team or Red Team environment. I have spent several years now working as Blue Team and Infastructure Managment for various jobs. I feel I have gained a well versed understanding on most company networks to have the knowledge it would take to Red Team for a consulting company.

If you're interested, take a look around my webpage. At the top is links to my resume, projects, and papers.

Thanks!
